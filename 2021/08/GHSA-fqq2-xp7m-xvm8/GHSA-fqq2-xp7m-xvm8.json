			"description": "`Singleton<T>` is meant to be a static object that can be initialized lazily. In\norder to satisfy the requirement that `static` items must implement `Sync`,\n`Singleton` implemented both `Sync` and `Send` unconditionally.\n\nThis allows for a bug where non-`Sync` types such as `Cell` can be used in\nsingletons and cause data races in concurrent programs.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `b0d2bd20e` by adding trait bounds, requiring\nthe contaiend type to implement `Sync`.\n",
