			"title": "HTTP Request Smuggling in actix-http",
			"description": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly detect invalid requests that could allow HTTP/1 request smuggling (HRS) attacks when running alongside a vulnerable front-end proxy server. This can result in leaked internal and/or user data, including credentials, when the front-end proxy is also vulnerable.\n\nPopular front-end proxies and load balancers already mitigate HRS attacks so it is recommended that they are also kept up to date; check your specific set up. You should upgrade even if the front-end proxy receives exclusively HTTP/2 traffic and connects to the back-end using HTTP/1; several downgrade attacks are known that can also expose HRS vulnerabilities.",
