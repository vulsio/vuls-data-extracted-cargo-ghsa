			"title": "Data race in tiny_future",
			"description": "tiny_future contains a light-weight implementation of Futures. The Future type it has lacked bound on its Send and Sync traits. This allows for a bug where non-thread safe types such as Cell can be used in Futures and cause data races in concurrent programs. The flaw was corrected in commit `c791919` by adding trait bounds to Future's Send and Sync.",
