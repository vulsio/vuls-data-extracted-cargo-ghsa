			"description": "An issue was discovered in the algorithmica crate through 2021-03-07 for Rust. In the affected versions of this crate, `merge_sort::merge()` wildly duplicates and drops ownership of `T` without guarding against double-free. Due to such implementation, simply invoking `merge_sort::merge()` on `Vec<T: Drop>` can cause **double free** bugs.\n",
