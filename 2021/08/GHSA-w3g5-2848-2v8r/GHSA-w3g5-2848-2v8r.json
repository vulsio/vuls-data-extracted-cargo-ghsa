			"description": "The `Generator` type is an iterable which uses a generator function that yields\nvalues. In affected versions of the crate, the provided function yielding values\nhad no `Send` bounds despite the `Generator` itself implementing `Send`.\n\nThe generator function lacking a `Send` bound means that types that are\ndangerous to send across threads such as `Rc` could be sent as part of a\ngenerator, potentially leading to data races.\n\nThis flaw was fixed in commit [`f7d120a3b`](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/generator-rs/commit/f7d120a3b724d06a7b623d0a4306acf8f78cb4f0)\nby enforcing that the generator function be bound by `Send`.",
