			"description": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket<T>` & `WriteTicket<T>`.\nThis allows to send non-Send `T` to other threads.\n\nThis can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as `T` of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`.\n",
