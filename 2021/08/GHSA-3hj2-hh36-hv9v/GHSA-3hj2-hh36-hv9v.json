			"description": "In the affected versions of this crate, Demuxer<T> unconditionally implemented Send with no trait bounds on T. This allows sending a non-Send type T across thread boundaries, which can cause undefined behavior like unlocking a mutex from a thread that didn't lock the mutex, or memory corruption from data race. The flaw was corrected in commit `0562cbf` by adding a T: Send bound to the Send impl for Demuxer<T>.",
