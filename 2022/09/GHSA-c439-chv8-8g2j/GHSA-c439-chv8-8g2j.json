			"description": "The [`os_socketaddr`](https://crates.io/crates/os_socketaddr) crate has assumed `std::net::SocketAddrV4` and `std::net::SocketAddrV6` have the same memory layout as the system C representation `sockaddr`. It has simply casted the pointers to convert the socket addresses to the system representation.\n\nThese layout were [changed into idiomatic rust types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78802) in nightly `std`. Starting from rustc 1.64 the affected versions of this crate will have undefined behaviour.\n\n",
