			"description": "### Impact\n\nThe affected version of this crate incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. \n\nHowever, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`.\n\nThis can cause the following problems:\n\n- Unaligned memory accesses\n- Data race\n\nCrates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue.\n\n32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue.\n32-bit targets with `Atomic{I,U}64` and `{i,u}64` have the same alignment are also not affected by this issue.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the builtin targets that may be affected.
