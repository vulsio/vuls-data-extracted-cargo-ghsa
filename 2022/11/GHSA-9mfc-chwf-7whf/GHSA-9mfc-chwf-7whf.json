			"description": "### Impact\n\nWhen a transaction contains a dep group with many cells, the resources required to process it are not linear to the transaction size nor spent script cycles. \n\n### Patches\n\nIn 0.43.3, nodes drop the transactions relayed to them when they contain a dep group with more than 64 cells. They do not ban peers who send them such transactions.\n\nIn 0.100, the consensus disallow transactions using a dep group with more than 64 cells. Peers relaying such transaction must be banned. Blocks committing such transactions must be rejected.\n",
