			"title": "Incorrect is_static parameter for custom stateful precompiles in SputnikVM (evm)",
			"description": "### Impact\n\nA custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide if stateful operations should be done. Previously, the passed `is_static` parameter was incorrect -- it was only set to `true` if the call comes from a **direct** `STATICCALL` opcode. However, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static. \n\nThe issue only impacts custom precompiles that actually uses `is_static`. The maintainers estimate the usage is low. However, for those affected, it can lead to possible incorrect state transitions.\n\n### Patches\n\nPR: https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/pull/133\nReleased in v0.36.0.\n\nOlder patch versions can be released on request if anyone needs them. Simply contact @sorpaas by email to request it.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [evm repo](https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm)\n* Email Wei at [wei@that.world](mailto:wei@that.world)\n",
