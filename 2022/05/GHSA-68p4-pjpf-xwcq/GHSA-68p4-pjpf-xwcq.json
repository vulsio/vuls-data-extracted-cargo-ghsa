			"description": "Affected versions of this crate used ptr::copy when inserting into the middle of a Vec. When ownership was temporarily duplicated during this copy, it calls the clone method of a user provided element.\n\nThis issue can result in an element being double-freed if the clone call panics.\n\nCommit `20cb73d` fixed this issue by adding a set_len(0) call before operating on the vector to avoid dropping the elements during a panic.",
