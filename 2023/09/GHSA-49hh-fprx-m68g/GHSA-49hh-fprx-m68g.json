			"title": "Default functions in VolatileMemory trait lack bounds checks, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses",
			"description": "### Impact\nAn issue was discovered in the default implementations of the `VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut, get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a `VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the functionâ€™s `count` argument. No implementations of `get_slice` provided in `vm_memory` are affected. Users of custom `VolatileMemory` implementations may be impacted if the custom implementation does not adhere to `get_slice`'s documentation.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue started in version 0.1.0 but was fixed in version 0.12.2 by inserting a check that verifies that the `VolatileSlice` returned by `get_slice` is of the correct length.\n\n### Workarounds\nNot Required\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/commit/aff1dd4a5259f7deba56692840f7a2d9ca34c9c8\nhttps://crates.io/crates/vm-memory/0.12.2\n",
