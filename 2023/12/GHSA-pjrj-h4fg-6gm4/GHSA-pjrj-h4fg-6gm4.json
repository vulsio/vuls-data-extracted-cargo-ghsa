			"description": "### Impact\nThe tokio-boring library in version 4.0.0 is affected by a memory leak issue that can lead to excessive resource consumption and potential DoS by resource exhaustion. The `set_ex_data` function used by the library did not deallocate memory used by pre-existing data in memory each time after completing a TLS connection causing the program to consume more resources with each new connection.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in version 4.1.0 of tokio-boring.\n\n### References\n[CVE-2023-6180 at cve.org](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6180)\n",
