			"title": "Improper handling of NTS cookie length that could crash the ntpd-rs server",
			"description": "### Impact\nntpd-rs does not validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the server. An attacker can crash the server by sending a specially crafted NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server expects. The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets.\n\nntpd-rs running purely as an ntp client is not affected.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was caused by improper slice indexing. The indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that do not crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error condition. A patch was released in version 0.3.3\n\n### Workarounds\nntpd-rs running purely as an ntp client is not affected. By default, ntpd-rs packages are not configured to run as a server.\n\nFor machines where serving the time is required, there is no known workaround. Users are recommended to upgrade ntpd-rs as soon as possible.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/pull/752\n\nWe would like to thank @mlichvar for identifying this issue\n",
