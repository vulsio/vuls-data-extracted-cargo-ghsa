			"title": "Unlimited number of NTS-KE connections can crash ntpd-rs server",
			"description": "### Summary\nMissing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected.\n\n### Details\nOperating systems have a limit for the number of open file descriptors (which includes sockets) in a single process, e.g. 1024 on Linux by default. When ntpd-rs is configured as an NTS server, it accepts TCP connections for the NTS-KE service. If the process has reached the descriptor limit and tries to accept a new TCP connection, the accept() system call will return with the EMFILE error and cause ntpd-rs to abort.\n\nA remote attacker can open a large number of parallel TCP connections to the server to trigger this crash. The connections need to be opened quickly enough to avoid the `key-exchange-timeout-ms` timeout (by default 1000 milliseconds).\n\n### Impact\nOnly NTS-KE server configuration are affected. Those without an NTS-KE server configuration such as NTS client only or NTP only configuration are unaffected. For affected configurations the ntpd-rs daemon can made completely unavailable by crashing the service. If ntpd-rs is automatically restarted, an attacker can repeat the attack to prevent ntpd-rs from doing anything useful.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Disable NTS-KE server functionality\n- Increase system resource limits (`RLIMIT_NOFILE`) to make the attack more difficult\n- Lower the `key-exchange-timeout-ms` configuration setting to make the attack more difficult",
