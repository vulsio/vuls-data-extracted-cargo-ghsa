			"description": "### Impact\nThe phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a reachable `assert!` guard on the phonenumber string.\n\nIn a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the \"number\" part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56.\n\nSince f69abee1/0.3.4/#52.\n\n0.2.x series is not affected.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to 0.3.6 or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\nn/a\n\n### References\nWhereas https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/issues/69 did not provide an example code path, property testing found a few: `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`.\n",
